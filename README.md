Set the field Use classpath of module to desktop, then click on the button of the Main class field and select the DesktopLauncher class. Set the Working directory to your android/assets/ (or your_project_path/core/assets/) folder! Click Apply and then OK. You have now created a run configuration for your desktop project.
